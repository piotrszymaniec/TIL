Quest to find replacement for docker and programming tools in windows

https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/48003

Why: I spent 2 days to find solutions to error of installing wsl2 on win which is needed for docker, which is used in next 13.4 course ...
Needles to say i still have not continued the course, and im not sure if I want to waste more time on my machines problem with installing linux distribution for wsl2.

I'd like to totally be able to replace that need with other tools, btw dropping rabit holes instead of jumping it to straight away would be nice.  
Learn to weight pros and cons and set a time limit that i would stop searching for unnecessary but convenient solutions (lough cry).
